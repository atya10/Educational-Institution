# Educational-Institution

A complete project for an educational institution that contains a complete database in addition to interfaces in the Java language linked to the database.

# The Question
Project - Phase II
Each student is required to submit a completed Java project with graphical interfaces so that the program connects to an Oracle database on the same machine.
Depending on the nature of the project, the program must contain at least all of the following:
- Login screen
- Screen to display the data
Data entry screen
- Screen to delete data
- Data update screen

Note: The Java program connects to the database, then calls procedures or functions. There should be no SQL or PL/SQL statements in the Java project other than the part necessary to call the functions defined in the databases.

For the database: it must contain at least 6 tables. Also, please re-attach the SQL code related to it and explain it in this delivery as well to facilitate follow-up
Good luck everyone
